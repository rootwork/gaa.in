<p><strong>Medication abortion is safe and effective, and abortion pills have been used around the world for decades.</strong></p>

<p>Although Americans lost the constitutional right to abortion with the overturning of Roe v. Wade in June 2022, Attorney General Merrick Garland <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-attorney-general-states-cant-ban-fda-approved-abortion-pills-2022-6">has since said</a> that states can’t ban abortion pills that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p>

<p>Abortion pills are FDA-approved for ending a pregnancy up to 10 weeks, but they’re also used off-label later than this in some states.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.womenonweb.org/en/i-need-an-abortion">Women On Web provides abortion pills by mail</a></strong> in exchange for a donation, and also offers other consultive services.</p>
