This website is meant to be a way for anyone who searches "How to get an abortion in ..." to get relevant information regardless of their local laws on what people "may" or "may not" tell them about abortion and reproductive services.

Modeled on **[howtogetanabortioninsouthcarolina.com](https://howtogetanabortioninsouthcarolina.com)** after the absurd proposed bill that would [outlaw websites about abortion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/07/22/south-carolina-bill-abortion-websites/?itid=hp-more-top-stories) ([non-paywalled article](https://www.democraticunderground.com/10142946105)) in that state.

This website is not meant to supplant any of the excellent resources already out there prepared by reproductive health providers and advocates. We are still gathering information specific to each state, especially states where abortion is or soon will be outlawed.

If you have any suggestions of resources for specific states, or any questions about this project, please [contact us](/contact/).
